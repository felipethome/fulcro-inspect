Inspect Fulcro applications

## Usage

Add the latest version of this library (see above) as a dependency:

```
[fulcrologic/fulcro-inspect "x.x.x"]
```

Add a preload to your compiler options:

```clojure
:compiler {...
           :preloads        [fulcro.inspect.preload]}
```

The inspector will find the running Fulcro application, and be ready to inspect it!

Next you have to install the Chrome Extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fulcro-inspect/meeijplnfjcihnhkpanepcaffklobaal

Be sure to reload your page after installing it. Now you can see the Fulcro logo get colors when it detects a Fulcro app, from then open Fulcro Inspect tab on the Chrome Devtools and happy inspecting!

### DB Tab

The DB tab contains the state of the app.

Use the triangles to expand/collapse data:

Click on expanded keys to watch their content:

![Watch DB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-inspect/develop/doc/db-watch.gif)

Use `cmd`/`meta` key + click to expand/collapse the whole sub-tree:

## Contributing

To run the development version of the extension, first install the npm packages:

```
npm install
```

And then run the shadow compilation:

```
npm run dev-chrome
```

The go in at Chrome extensions and add the unpackaged version from the path `shells/chrome`.

Remember to disable the chrome store version to avoid having multiple instances running.

To use the client versin on the app, install locally with `lein install` or use clojure
deps.edn to point the `:local/root` at this repository.
